Welcome to the hk_classes library

hk_classes is a set of non-visual routines which allow you to develop
database frontend applications as easy as possible.

You need also a database driver to run applications. Drivers for
* mdb (M$ Access),
* Mysql,
* Postgresql,
* SQLite version 2.x,
* SQLite version 3.x and
* ODBC

are included in this library and will be automatically installed if 
configure finds a working Mysql/Postgresql/SQLite/ODBC installation 
on your computer.

Optionally it is possible to use graphical frontend libraries 
(e.g. hk_kdeclasses) to write intermediate X-database-applications
with just a few lines.

Read INSTALL how to install this library.
